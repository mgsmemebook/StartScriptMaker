# StartScriptMaker V.1.2

#### This bash script adds start scripts to your individual Minecraft servers.

You can also add a Bungeecord server script. <br/>
This script lets you create a global start script, which executes all the previously defined server scripts. <br/>
Currently, the global start script only supports kde konsole.
